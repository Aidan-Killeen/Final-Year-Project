# Final-Year-Project
The Final Year Project that I made for my Trinity College BA (Hons) in Computer Science

The Project is in two parts: Dungeon Sprawl, which is an Android App which has basic gameplay, and Dungeon Edit, which is a java program that creates levels for Dungeon Sprawl
The code for each part of the project is in the Code subfolder, whilst examples of the compiled apps are in the "Compiled Apps" Subfolder
A Full Writeup of the Project is in the FYP Writeup file

Note that the Levels.json used by the Dungeon Sprawl App are set when the App is compiled, and is found in "./Code/DungeonSprawl/app/src/main/assets". The app has to be recompiled every time something is changed in the levels in order to update the levels used in the app. This can be done manually or by using the DungeonEdit jar.
